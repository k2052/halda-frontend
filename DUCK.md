We can use Fuse.js for searching. http://julio-ody.tumblr.com/post/49220862778/backbone-collection-fuzzy-search-with-fuse-js
searching will both execute the query on the models and go server side for more items.

Clicking a collection should be treated as a filter.

Search will resemble designinspiration.net
